# Hover Music Hub(HMH)

⚠**HMH is still in heavy development, and a public release have not been officially published.⚠**

## What is HMH?

Hover Music Hub is a community driven application built with Electron + Vue.js with the specific goal of creating an application that music lovers would love. It is where music lovers would come to if they need to:

* Discover new music
* Share their listening habits/history with others
* Chat with other Music Lovers
* Write an review for songs/albums
* Read reviews for songs/albums

## How do I download?

As of currently, we have not distributed any downloadable copies, as the app is nowhere near completion. 

## How long do I need to wait?

We have no estimated completion time as we are still very early in development.

## How do I contribute?

Please make your edits on your own branch and then create a pull edit on the beta branch once you finish making your edits and verifying that the application works.
